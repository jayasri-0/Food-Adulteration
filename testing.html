            <h2>Chemical Testing</h2>
            <p>Chemical analysis techniques used to detect additives, contaminants, or other chemical changes in food.
                Common methods include chromatography (e.g., HPLC, GC), spectroscopy (e.g., FTIR, UV-Vis), and mass
                spectrometry.</p>
            <h3>Methods of Chemical Testing</h3>
            <h4>Chromatography</h4>
            <p>Chromatography separates components in a food sample based on their interactions with a mobile and
                stationary
                phase. Common methods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): Used for separating and quantifying compounds.</li>
                <li>Gas Chromatography (GC): Analyzes volatile compounds in gas phase.</li>
                <li>Sample Preparation:Food samples are prepared by extraction to isolate the compounds of interest.
                </li>
                <li>Instrumentation:HPLC or GC systems consist of a column, injector, detector, and data analysis
                    software.</li>
                <li>Separation:The sample is injected into the chromatographic column where components separate based on
                    their affinity
                    for the stationary phase.</li>
                <li>Detection:As separated components elute from the column, they are detected by a detector
                    (e.g., UV detector for HPLC, FID or MS detector for GC) based on their chemical properties and
                    concentration.</li>
                <li>Analysis:Data from the detector is analyzed to identify and quantify compounds present in the food
                    sample.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Spectroscopy</h3>
            <p>Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis) are used to analyze
                the molecular structure and chemical composition of food samples. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sample Preparation:Food samples are typically ground into a fine powder or prepared in a suitable
                    form for analysis.</li>
                <li>Instrumentation:FTIR and UV-Vis spectrometers measure the absorption, emission, or reflection of
                    light by the sample.</li>
                <li>Measurement:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>FTIR: Measures the absorption of infrared light by the sample to identify functional groups and
                        molecular structures.</li>
                    <li>UV-Vis: Measures the absorption of UV or visible light to quantify the concentration of
                        compounds such as vitamins, pigments, or additives.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Interpretation:Spectral data is compared against known standards or databases to identify
                    specific compounds or verify product specifications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mass Spectrometry</h3>
            <p>Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful technique used to determine the molecular mass and structure of
                compounds in food samples.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sample Preparation:Similar to chromatography, food samples are prepared and often purified to
                    isolate target compounds.</li>
                <li>Ionization:The sample is ionized by techniques like electron ionization (EI), electrospray
                    ionization (ESI),
                    or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).</li>
                <li>Separation and Detection:Ionized molecules are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)
                    in a mass
                    analyzer (e.g., quadrupole, time-of-flight).</li>
                <li>Analysis:Mass spectra are generated and analyzed to determine the molecular weight, fragmentation
                    patterns, and structural information of compounds present in the sample.</li>
            </ul>
